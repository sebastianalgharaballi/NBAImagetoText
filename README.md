# NBAImagetoText
Here is my NBA image-to-text project. Posted below is the Kaggle link to my custom dataset of NBA player pictures that I used for the project. I managed to train my model to get 12/15 test images correct, and achieved a bleu score of 0.6744, to go along with a minimized loss of 0.1379. Uploaded to this repo is my model file (using an encoder CNN, decoder RNN, and mapping between the two), utilities file, training file, test images, captions file containing all image ID's and player names for captions, caption loader file, evaluation notebook, and research paper pertaining to how my model precisely runs and in-depth explanations regarding my datasets and results. Huge thank you to Aladdin Persson, who's deep learning tutorials on YouTube helped me tremendously in learning the frameworks for how these types of systems work and how to correctly code a solution that pertained to my unique project.
