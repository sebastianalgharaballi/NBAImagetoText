# NBAImagetoText
Here is my NBA image-to-text project. Posted below is the Kaggle link to my custom dataset of NBA player pictures that I used for the project. I managed to train the model to get 12/15 test images correct, and achieved a bleu score of 0.6744. Uploaded to this repo is my model file, utilities file, training file, test images, and evalation notebook. Huge thank you to Aladdin Persson, who's deep learning tutorials on YouTube helped me tremendously in learning the frameworks for how these types of systems work and how to correctly code a solution that pertained to my unique project.
